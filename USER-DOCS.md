# Deeproof User Guide

**Your Identity, Your Privacy, Your Proof.**

---

## What is Deeproof?

Deeproof is a privacy-focused identity verification service for the world of digital assets and real-world investments.

Think of it like this: when you sign up for a bank account or trading platform, they ask you to prove who you are. You upload your passport, take a selfie, and share personal details. This process is called KYC (Know Your Customer).

The problem? Every time you join a new platform, you have to do this all over again. Your sensitive information ends up stored in dozens of different databases, each one a potential target for hackers.

**Deeproof changes this.**

With Deeproof, you prove your identity once at a trusted platform (like Binance), and then use that proof anywhere else — without ever sharing your personal documents again.

## Who is Deeproof For?

Deeproof is for anyone who:

- Uses cryptocurrency exchanges and wants to access new investment platforms
- Values their privacy and wants to minimize how much personal data they share online
- Is tired of repeating identity verification on every new platform
- Wants to protect themselves from identity theft and data breaches

Whether you're an experienced investor or just getting started, Deeproof helps keep your personal information safe while still meeting the verification requirements that platforms need.

## How Does It Work? (The Simple Version)

Deeproof uses a clever approach called "Inherited Trust":

1. **You've Already Been Verified**: If you have a verified account at Binance (or other supported platforms in the future), that platform has already confirmed your identity.

2. **Deeproof Creates Proof**: Instead of sharing your documents again, Deeproof creates a mathematical proof that says "This person has passed verification at a trusted platform" — without revealing any personal details.

3. **Platforms Accept the Proof**: Other platforms can verify this proof and trust that you're a real, verified person, without ever seeing your passport, address, or selfie.

**The magic?** Your actual identity information never leaves your computer. Only the proof does.

## Core Features

### One-Time Verification, Universal Access
Verify your identity through Binance once. Use that verification across multiple platforms forever. No more uploading your passport to strangers.

### Your Data Never Leaves Your Device
Unlike traditional verification, your personal information stays on your computer. Platforms only see cryptographic proof — a mathematical confirmation that verifies you're real without revealing who you are.

### Permanent On-Chain Record
Once verified, your status is recorded on a public ledger (blockchain). This creates an unchangeable record that proves your verification is legitimate, without exposing any personal details.

### Identity Score
Your dashboard shows an "Identity Score" based on how many platforms you've verified with. Higher scores may unlock more opportunities across participating platforms.

### Browser-Based Convenience
Everything works through your web browser. No special apps to download to your phone. No QR codes to scan. Just your desktop browser and a simple extension.

## Your Journey with Deeproof

Here's what using Deeproof looks like from start to finish:

### Step 1: Visit the Deeproof Website
Go to the Deeproof website and click "Launch App" to open your dashboard.

### Step 2: Connect Your Wallet
Click "Connect Wallet" to link your cryptocurrency wallet. This is how platforms will recognize your verified status.

### Step 3: Install the Deeproof Extension
Install the Deeproof browser extension for Chrome. This extension is what creates your privacy-preserving proof.

### Step 4: Log Into Binance
Open Binance in your browser and make sure you're logged into your verified account. You need to have completed their identity verification (at least Level 2).

### Step 5: Generate Your Proof
Click on the Deeproof extension icon in your browser. Then click "Verify via Binance." The extension will automatically create your privacy proof using your active Binance session.

### Step 6: Record Your Verification
Return to the Deeproof dashboard. You'll see your pending proof. Click "Process" to record your verification on the blockchain. Confirm the transaction in your wallet.

### Step 7: You're Verified!
Once confirmed, your dashboard will show a green "Verified" status. Any platform that uses Deeproof can now verify your status without ever seeing your personal details.

## What Information is Used?

### What IS Used:
- **Your verification status**: Simply whether or not you've passed identity checks at Binance
- **Your wallet address**: The public address you connect to the dashboard
- **A unique identifier**: A random code created on your computer that represents your proof

### What is NOT Used or Stored:
- Your name
- Your email address
- Your physical address
- Your passport, ID card, or any documents
- Your face or selfie
- Your date of birth
- Your phone number

**No personal information is ever sent to Deeproof servers or stored anywhere outside your own browser.**

---

## Privacy and Trust

### How Your Privacy is Protected

**Everything happens on your computer.** When you click "Verify," the mathematical proof is created right there in your browser. Your personal details from Binance never travel over the internet to Deeproof or any third party.

**Only proof, never data.** What gets recorded is essentially a "yes/no" answer to the question "Is this person verified?" — not any information about who you actually are.

**You control your identity.** Your verification is tied to your wallet, which only you control. No one can verify or use your identity without your approval.

### What You Can Trust

- **Binance already verified you.** Deeproof doesn't do its own verification. It simply proves you've already been verified elsewhere.

- **Math guarantees validity.** The proof system uses well-established mathematical techniques. If the proof says you're verified, it's mathematically impossible to fake.

- **Open verification records.** Anyone can check that a verification happened on the blockchain, but no one can extract personal information from it.

- **No middleman holds your data.** Unlike traditional verification companies, Deeproof doesn't store your documents in a database that could be hacked.

## Requirements

To use Deeproof, you need:

- **A Desktop Computer**: Windows, Mac, or Linux
- **Google Chrome Browser**: The Deeproof extension currently works with Chrome
- **A Verified Binance Account**: You must have completed Binance's identity verification (Level 2 or higher)
- **A Cryptocurrency Wallet**: Any wallet that connects to websites (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or similar)
- **A Small Amount of Test Tokens**: To record your verification on the blockchain, you'll need some tokens for the transaction fee (currently using test network, so no real money required)

---

## Limitations and Important Notes

### Current Status

Deeproof is currently in **testing phase**. This means:

- Only Binance verification is working right now
- The system runs on a test network (not real money or transactions)
- Features may change as development continues

### Things to Know

- **One identity per account**: Each Binance account can only create one Deeproof identity. This prevents people from creating multiple fake identities.

- **Keep your browser secure**: Since proof generation happens in your browser, make sure your computer isn't compromised.

- **Extension required**: The browser extension is necessary for the verification process. The website alone cannot create proofs.

- **Wallet needed**: You must connect a cryptocurrency wallet to record your verification. Without a wallet, you can't complete the process.

### Support

If you encounter issues or have questions, check the website for support resources and community links.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Do I need to pay anything?**
Currently, Deeproof runs on a test network, so no real money is required. When launching on the main network, small transaction fees may apply.

**Is my Binance password shared with Deeproof?**
No. The extension reads your verification status from your active Binance session. It never sees or accesses your password.

**What if I lose access to my wallet?**
Your verification is tied to your wallet. If you lose access to your wallet, you would need to create a new verification with a new wallet.

**Can Deeproof see my trading activity?**
No. Deeproof only checks whether you've passed identity verification. It cannot see your balances, trades, or any other account activity.

**What makes this different from just showing a screenshot of my verification?**
Screenshots can be faked. Deeproof's mathematical proofs are impossible to forge. If the proof verifies, it's guaranteed to be real.
